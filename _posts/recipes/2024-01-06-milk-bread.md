- Mixing & kneading: 30ish min  
- Bulk rise: 30–90 min (plus overnight optional)

## Ingredients

<i>Here are two variations — one standard and one richer (brioche-style). You can shape these into loaves or rolls.</i>

### Tangzhong (same for both)
- ¼ cup water  
- 2 Tbsp whole milk  
- 2 Tbsp bread flour

### Option 1 (standard garlic-dill rolls)
- ½ cup whole milk  
- 4 Tbsp melted butter (plus 2 Tbsp more for garlic topping)  
- ¼ cup sugar  
- 2 Tbsp nonfat dry milk powder  
- 1 Tbsp dried dill  
- 2 tsp instant yeast  
- 1 tsp Diamond Crystal kosher salt  
- 1 tsp garlic powder  
- 1 egg  
- 2½ cups bread flour

Garlic butter topping:
- 2–3 cloves garlic, chopped  
- ½ tsp garlic powder  
- ½ tsp kosher salt  
- 2 Tbsp chopped fresh dill

### Option 2 (enriched/brioche-style loaves)
- 1 cup whole milk or buttermilk  
- 4 eggs (reserve 1 for egg wash)  
- ¼ cup sugar (or up to ½ cup for sweeter)  
- 2 Tbsp vegetable or olive oil  
- 2¾ tsp Diamond Crystal kosher salt  
- 2 tsp active dry yeast  
- 3¾ cups all-purpose flour  
- ½ cup unsalted butter, cubed and chilled

## Instructions
1. **Make the tangzhong:**  
    Whisk tangzhong ingredients in a small saucepan or skillet. Cook over low heat, stirring constantly, until thick like pudding (about 2 minutes). Scrape into stand mixer bowl and let cool (you can throw it in the freezer for 10 min to speed up).

2. **Make the dough:**  
    Add all ingredients (except butter if using enriched version) to the bowl. Mix on low until combined, then knead:
    - For garlic-dill: Mix ~20–25 min on low until soft, smooth dough forms.  
    - For enriched: Knead 12 min on medium-low, then add butter in two stages, kneading 10–15 min more until dough is elastic and passes windowpane test.

3. **First rise:**  
    Cover the bowl and rest dough at room temp for 30–90 minutes until doubled. Optionally, chill overnight for better flavor.

4. **Shape:**  
    Deflate dough and divide into 10 pieces. Roll into tight balls and place in greased round pan or loaf pans (2×4 layout for loaves).

5. **Final proof:**  
    Cover loosely and proof 2–3 hours until very puffy. Use the finger dent test to confirm readiness.

6. **Egg wash & bake:**  
    Preheat oven to 350ºF. Beat 1 egg and brush rolls or loaves. Bake 25–35 min until golden and 190ºF inside.

7. **Finish (optional for garlic-dill):**  
    Melt 2 Tbsp butter with garlic, garlic powder, and salt. Remove from heat, stir in dill, and brush over rolls while warm. It will feel like a lot — that's the point.
