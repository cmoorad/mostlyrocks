## Ingredients

<i>Here are some quick-reference options for different sizes. You can use baker's ratios to make any size. If you want to make two loaves you can double the recipe and split them at step 5 — just be aware that the ingredients will rise to 6x their original size.</i>

### Option 1 (standard)
- 425 g bread flour  
- 75 g whole wheat flour  
- 400 g water (75º to 85º F)  
- 10 g salt  
- 20 g sourdough starter (unfed is fine; fed also works; more is okay too)

### Option 2 (larger)
- 500 g bread flour  
- 88 g whole wheat flour  
- 470 g water  
- 12 g salt  
- 23 g starter

### Option 3 (smaller)
- 400 g bread flour  
- 70 g whole wheat flour  
- 376 g water  
- 9 g salt  
- 18 g starter

## Instructions

1. Combine all ingredients in a large bowl. Mix by hand until flour is hydrated. Cover with plastic wrap and rest for 15 minutes.
2. Wet your hand, fold all 4 sides of the dough toward the center, then cover and rest for 15 minutes.
3. Repeat step 2 three more times (4 folds total), wetting your hand each time.
4. Leave dough seam-side down at room temperature to rise for up to 24 hours. Mark the height; it should double or more.
5. Turn dough onto a floured surface. Gently form a round by folding four sides inward. Flip seam-side down and rest for 10 minutes, lightly covered.
6. Dust a banneton generously with whole wheat flour.
7. Shape the dough into a batard: flip the round over, tug the dough outward slightly, fold the left side over the center, then the right side over that. Roll up from the bottom and place seam-side up in the banneton. Cover and refrigerate.
8. Refrigerate for 4 to 12 hours (or up to 48) until proofed.
9. Preheat oven to 500ºF with Dutch oven inside.
10. Turn out loaf onto parchment paper (seam side down), slash gently (not too deep), and place in Dutch oven.
11. Bake covered (lid on) at 500ºF for 20 minutes.
12. Reduce oven to 450ºF and bake uncovered for 35–50 minutes. Darker crust = more flavor.
13. Cool completely on a wire rack before slicing.
