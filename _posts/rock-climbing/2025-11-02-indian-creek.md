Back to the Creek! We only spent a week there this time but we made the most of it. It was especially great to be down there with good friends. Having been there alone once before I wouldn't have it any other way.

    <h2><b>Beginnings</b></h2>
    With the rack secured, cams labeled, and a promising weather forecast, all that was left to do was drive 18 hours! Fortunately we got to break it up by seeing Jack's sister in Ketchum, ID.

    <h2><b>Pistol Whipped</b></h2>
    On our first day we went to Pistol Whipped. I warmed up on Spaghetti Western which turns out isn't a warm up, but it may be my favorite climb in the creek. The climbing was varied with a middle section that featured a 30-foot, overhanging hand crack! We also climbed Revenge of the Rock Gods and Jolly Rancher, the latter of which was well deserving of the hype and fortunately reached with our 78.5 meter rope.

    <h2><b>Sparks Wall</b></h2>
    I had really been looking forward to visiting this crag and I think it was a bit underwhelming. Big crowds, not a ton of moderate climbs...still a fun day, just not what I expected. We warmed up on Skraps, then climbed Jump Start and Sparkling Gefilte Fish, and after a lot of waiting I was eventaully able to get on Go Sparky Go for an onsite. A fun day but I probably won't be going back to this crag unless I'm feeling ready to send Old Sparky.

    <h2><b>Fin Wall</b></h2>
    After warming up on Walkin Talkin Bob, Jack T and I climbed The Last Day by accident thinking it was Double Trouble. According to the Mountain Project comments, Mason Earle made the same mistake in 2007. I finished the day on Nagasaki which was a ton of fun.

    <h2><b>Optimator</b></h2>
    I really wanted to go back to Optimator to send Soulfire and Annunaki and maybe climb Neat. Even though we made it up early, the only party that beat us was, of course, already on Neat — and putting out bad vibes besides. I warmed up on Soulfire and fell at the top again (classic). The crowds quickly thickened and lots of people aided up Annunaki while I sat at the base waiting for a redpoint attempt. I even climbed Lady Pillar while waiting. Not exactly the experience I wanted, but in the end I sent Annunaki without any trouble which made it feel worth it, if barely. I then climbed Caseys and belayed Jack T on Cobweb Splitter and Hayutake after yet more shennanigans with the crowds. This was a great reminder that the scene in the creek can be overwhelming and it's generally worth going to less-popular crags when you can. I'll always love Optimator, but I probably won't be going back soon!

    18 hours later — with red sand in our shoes and desert sun in our hearts — and we landed back in wet, dark Washington! Our hopes that the snows would be soon to follow were shortly squandered and left us swearing to a longer trip next year!$$
