Hi â€” I'm Chris. I live in Leavenworth, WA and I created this website to document pictures from climbing + skiing trips.

### Climbing
Some friends took me rock climbing for the first time in 2017. I fell in love with climbing a few years later at Index, WA.

### Skiing
I started splitboarding in 2018 and am fortunate to have ridden in some cool places despite being mediocre at the sport.

### Website
I built this website using various free Jekyll templates which are licensed on my GitHub account, @cmoorad.
