Iâ€™m originally from La Jolla, CA and now reside in Leavenworth, WA. I created this website to document pictures and learnings from climbing + skiing trips.

### Climbing
Some friends took me rock climbing for the first time in 2017. I fell in love with climbing a few years later at Index, WA.


### Skiing
I started splitboarding in 2018 and am fortunate to have ridden in some cool places despite being mediocre at the sport.

### Website
The website was built using various free Jekyll templates which are licensed on my GitHub account.
