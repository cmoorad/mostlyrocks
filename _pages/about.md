Hi — I'm Chris. I live in Leavenworth, WA and I created this website to document pictures from climbing + snowboarding trips.

### Climbing
Some friends took me rock climbing for the first time in 2017. I fell in love with climbing a few years later at Index, WA.

### Snowboarding
I started splitboarding in 2018 and am fortunate to have ridden in some cool places despite being mediocre at the sport.

### Website
I built this website using various free Jekyll templates and coding with lots of AI assistance. The templates I used are licensed on my GitHub account — @cmoorad.
